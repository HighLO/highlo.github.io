# Market Participants Survey

This survey is part of a master's thesis exploring how traders and market participants perceive financial market regulation and compliance enforcement in Europe, particularly regarding market manipulation and spoofing.

## What is MAR?

The Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) is a set of European Union rules designed to ensure fair and transparent financial markets. It prohibits practices like spoofing, insider trading, and price manipulation, ensuring that all market participants operate under the same standards. MAR is enforced by regulators and compliance officers to prevent unfair advantages in trading.

## What is FATAA?

Regulators increasingly use AI-driven detection tools to monitor trading behavior. However, these systems must follow Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, Accuracy, and Autonomy (FATAA) principles to ensure that enforcement is neutral and unbiased. This survey will explore how traders (Like yourself) perceive AI-based enforcement and its impact on compliance.

Estimated time to complete: 15 minutes<br>
Confidentiality: All responses will remain anonymous and used solely for academic research.<br>
Voluntary participation: You can stop at any time without providing a reason.

At the end of the survey, you will have the option to volunteer for a follow-up interview to discuss your experiences in more depth.
