# MSA Lab receives funding from Dutch Research Council
The Dutch Research Council (NWO) is a leading science funding organization in the Netherlands, funding and supporting top researchers. Their Take-off program stimulates entrepreneurship within Dutch knowledge institutions by bridging the funding gap between academic research and market application, helping valuable innovations take their first steps toward commercialization.

**The Market Surveillance Analytics (MSA) Lab received the Take-off grant to further develop its IP strategy, business model and go-to-market strategy for commercialization.**

**About MSA Lab**

Financial markets are increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated manipulative behaviors, disrupting prices and undermining effective risk management. To address this, WUR, CORMEC and CERN developed the MSA Lab: an advanced surveillance software applying novel particle physics methodologies to financial market data, to detect manipulation.

Built on CERNâ€™s ROOT framework, MSA Lab processes high-frequency data, produces large-scale statistical distributions, performs statistical analysis, and visualizes market behaviors with transparency and explainability. Unlike existing solutions, it integrates top-down and bottom-up approaches and facilitates cross-market surveillance.
