# Market Surveillance Analytics Lab (MSA Lab)

<center>

<p>
  The MSA Lab is a research-oriented platform developed within the HighLO project to assist regulators and exchanges in detecting manipulation in financial markets. Unlike black-box industry solutions, it emphasizes transparency, rigorous statistics, and full source code availability for trusted parties. Built in collaboration with CERN, the lab integrates insights from high-frequency market analysis and scientific computing to power manipulation detection systems.
