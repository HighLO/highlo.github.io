# Regulators Survey 

Thank you for participating in this survey on the enforcement of Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) in financial markets. This survey is part of a master's thesis exploring the regulatory challenges and ethical considerations of MAR enforcement, particularly in addressing spoofing.

## What is MAR?

The Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) is the European Union’s framework for detecting, preventing, and enforcing penalties against market manipulation, insider trading, and unfair trading practices. It applies to all financial market participants and is enforced by national regulators.

## What is FATAA?

As technology plays a larger role in market enforcement, regulators use AI-driven surveillance tools to detect manipulation. However, these tools must follow Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, Accuracy, and Autonomy (FATAA) principles to prevent biased or unfair enforcement. This survey will explore how AI-based regulation aligns with these principles and how it affects compliance.

Estimated time to complete: 15 minutes<br>
Confidentiality: All responses will remain anonymous and used solely for academic research.<br>
Voluntary participation: You can stop at any time without providing a reason.

At the end of the survey, you will have the option to volunteer for a follow-up interview to provide deeper insights into MAR enforcement.
